# Wide Residual Networks (BMVC 2016) 

Implementation of the paper [Wide Residual Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07146.pdf), BMVC 2016 by Sergey Zagoruyko and Nikos Komodakis.

Ever since the introduction of Deep Residual Networks in [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf), these models have shows 
ability to scale up to thousands of layers while still improving the performance. However, even a small increase in performance often requires increasing the number of layers by manifolds. To this end, in the paper Wide Residual Networks the authors have experimented with increasign the width of the network, instead of their depth and proposed **wide residual networks (WRNs)** which were able to outperform their thin and deep counterpart.
